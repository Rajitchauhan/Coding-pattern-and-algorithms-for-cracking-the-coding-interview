"""
Solution
The easiest way to solve this problem is to first transpose the matrix.
After transposing it,
you just have to reverse every single row in the transposed matrix.
That will rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.
Since we're doing the operation in-place, we don't have to return anything.
